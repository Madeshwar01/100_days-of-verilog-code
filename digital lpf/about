 Digital Filter Implementation using Matlab and Vivado

1. The MATLAB is used to generate the coefficient of the filter
   in the command window type,
   >>> fdatools

2.  fdatools window would open, change the sampling frequency,passband frequency and stopband frequency as per the requirement and can choose between low pass,high 
    pass , band pass and band stop filters

3.  Also can change the pass band and stop band attenuation as per the requirement

4.  Then navigate to set quantization parameter and change the filter arithmetic to fixed point for FPGA implementation

5.  The export the coefficient as coefficient file

6.  Then open the coefficient file with text editor such as notepad and remove the content in the above till the coefficient data and add 
    radix=10;
    coefdata=
    coefficient data seperate by commas and end with semicolon
    save it as .coe file

7.  Open Vivado and select create block design

8.  In add IP -> Select FIR compiler -> Select the source as COE file and browse the file

9.  Adjust the channel and implementation specification as per the requirement

10. By clicking finish at the summary the digital filter block would be generated
